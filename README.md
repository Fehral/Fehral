## Salutations.

May this page serve as a living journal displaying my endeavors in learning the fundamentals and particulars of networking and cybersecurity. In the interim, I'd like to showcase logical topologies and projects built with Cisco Packet Tracer to explore concepts of networking including, but not limited to, static and dynamic IPv4 addressing, subnetting, different routing protocols, and flat and hierarchical network design. I subscribe to the notion that one cannot protect (or attack) what one doesn't know, so it is only reasonable for me to learn the basics of internetworking. Within the subsequent repositories, I will be displaying the logical topologies with an overview of concepts explored during the building of such networks along with the .pkt files for scrutiny's sake (or those who are on this journey with me and share a similar learning style).

###### Disclaimer: I am not the original architect of these projects, but I personally found them to be perfect for my kinesthetic learning style. The source of my projects can be found on the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gtechtrainer">Gurutech Trainer</a>. Also, I realize that simulated networking in software is not comparable to working with physical networking hardware - I'm just a little guy.
