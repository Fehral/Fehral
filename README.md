### Fundamental network security requires fundamental network understanding.
May this page serve as a living journal in documenting my learning of basic networking into its more complex concepts of subnetting, design and architecture, protocols, configuration, and security.  All projects are built within Cisco Packet Tracer to develop an understanding of said concepts.  Each repository will feature an overview of concepts explored within each project as well as a logical topology map and device configuration commands used in Cisco IOS.

###### Disclaimer: I am not the original architect of these projects, but I personally found them to be perfect for my kinesthetic learning style. The source of my projects can be found on the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gtechtrainer">Gurutech Trainer</a>. Also, I realize that simulated networking in software is not comparable to working with physical networking hardware - I'm just a little guy.
